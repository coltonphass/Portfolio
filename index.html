        <p>
          Hey, I'm Colton, I'm 23 and a junior fullstack developer. I'm really
          into video games, cars, tech, and pretty much anything I can take
          apart and figure out how it works.
        </p>

        <p>
          My interest in tech started way back with Pokémon Red — that was the
          first time I really got curious about computers and games. Later on,
          games like TF2 and other mod-heavy stuff pushed that curiosity even
          further.
        </p>

        <p>
          I started messing with web development around 17, just learning HTML
          and CSS on my own at home. I didn't take it super seriously at first —
          just built random little sites and played around with Udemy courses.
          But when I hit 21, I got into C++, and that kind of changed
          everything. That's when I really started taking development seriously
          and realized how fun backend can actually be. I also completed my
          Associate's degree in Computer Information Systems (CIS), which helped
          give me a more solid foundation.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since then, I've been diving into fullstack development, working with
          JavaScript, Python, Linux, and even some Assembly just for fun. I run
          Linux on my main machine, and I love tweaking things, breaking stuff,
          and fixing it again. I'm all about open-source tools and learning by
          doing.
        </p>

        <p>
          Outside of coding, I'm into cars — I do my own repairs and love
          getting hands-on with vehicles as a hobby. I'm also big on anime (One
          Piece especially), and I'll always have a soft spot for retro games
          and anything nostalgic.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm still learning every day, but I love building things that actually
          work — whether it's a small game, a clean website, or just automating
          something dumb that saves me time. If it's tech-related, chances are
          I'm interested.
