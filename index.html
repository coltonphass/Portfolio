        <p>
          Hey, I'm Colton, I'm 23 and a junior fullstack developer. I'm really
          into video games, cars, tech, and pretty much anything I can take
          apart and figure out how it works.
        </p>

        <p>
          My interest in tech started way back with Pokémon Red — that was the
          first time I really got curious about computers and games. Later on,
          games like TF2 and other mod-heavy stuff pushed that curiosity even
          further.
        </p>

        <p>
          I started messing with web development around 17, just learning HTML
          and CSS on my own at home. I didn't take it super seriously at first —
          just built random little sites and played around with Udemy courses.
          But when I hit 21, I got into C++, and that kind of changed
          everything. That's when I really started taking development seriously
          and realized how fun backend can actually be. I also completed my
          Associate's degree in Computer Information Systems (CIS), which helped
          give me a more solid foundation.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm still learning every day, but I love building things— whether it's
          a small game, a website, or just automating something dumb that saves
          me time. If it's tech-related, chances are I'm interested.
        </p>
