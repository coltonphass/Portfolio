              A self-reflection amid frustration and self-doubt.

          <div class="blog-post-content">
            <p>
              In today’s world, we are constantly faced with the struggle of
              comparing ourselves to others. Whether it’s social media, YouTube,
              or other forms of online interaction, we often end up feeling
              worthless or not smart enough. The issue, however, may not be a
              lack of intelligence, but rather that we are approaching learning
              the wrong way.
            </p>

            <h2>Realization: Stop Comparing Yourself to Others</h2>
            <p>
              The first and most important step is to stop comparing yourself to
              other people. Learning is a deeply personal journey, one that far
              exceeds anyone else’s ideals, understandings, or approaches. It is
              unique to each individual, so the methods we use to learn will
              almost certainly differ.
            </p>

            <p>
              If we focus on our own self-improvement, no matter how small, and
              reinforce it with positivity, we can far surpass our previous
              expectations. This naturally leads to an important question:
              <i>what are our goals?</i>
            </p>

            <h2>Set Healthy Goals</h2>
            <p>
              What exactly is a healthy goal? A healthy goal is small,
              achievable, and realistic. It’s unfair to expect yourself to build
              a massive, full-stack application as your very first project.
              Instead, start with something manageable and give yourself a
              realistic timeline.
            </p>

            <p>
              Learn intentionally. Take notes. Reflect on what worked and what
              didn’t. And most importantly, relax. Programming is meant to be
              creative and enjoyable, not a source of constant stress or
              self-hatred.
            </p>

            <h3>Learn How to Break Things Down</h3>
            <p>
              Breaking problems into smaller pieces is a crucial skill. Write
              down what your program is supposed to do, identify where you feel
              stuck, and solve one small problem at a time.
            </p>

            <pre><code class ="language-python"># Example: Break a problem into small steps (Python)
# Goal: Track your study sessions and total focused time

sessions = [45, 45, 30]  # minutes of focused work
total_minutes = sum(sessions)
session_count = len(sessions)

print("Sessions:", session_count)
print("Total focused minutes:", total_minutes)
print("Total focused hours:", round(total_minutes / 60, 2))
</code></pre>

            <h3>Time Chunking</h3>
            <p>
              Set intentional time intervals for studying and take advantage of
              your brain’s natural efficiency. Deep learning happens best during
              focused flow states with minimal distractions. You can spend hours
              stuck on a single topic and still make very little progress.
            </p>

            <p>
              Instead, try 45 minutes of focused, enjoyable study followed by a
              30-minute break. Repeat this three times a day, and you’ll likely
              learn far more than you ever would during an exhausting eight-hour
              cram session.
            </p>

              “Silence is essential. We need silence just as much as we need
              air, just as much as plants need light. If our minds are crowded
              with words and thoughts, there is no space for us.” — Thich Nhat
              Hanh
            </blockquote>

            <h2>Make Programming Fun</h2>
            <p>
              If programming is something you truly want to pursue, it has to be
              enjoyable. I struggled with this deeply. As someone with Obsessive
              Compulsive Disorder, I often associated programming with boring,
              mundane, and exhausting tasks. Over time, this mindset led me
              straight into burnout—largely due to school pressure, constant
              comparison, and unrealistic expectations.
            </p>

            <p>
              That burnout forced me to reflect. If I wanted to pursue
              programming professionally, something had to change.
            </p>

            <p>
              I started talking with my college peers, playing games on
              CodinGame, experimenting with game engines, and learning Python
              through libraries like Pygame. For the first time in a long while,
              programming felt fun again. I was working on things I genuinely
              cared about and seeing my ideas come to life.
            </p>

            <h2>Repetition Is Important</h2>
            <p>
              I would often, like I previously stated, do 8 hour crams for my
              Programming II assignments. I would ChatGPT my way through them
              and end up coming out with a decent program. Ultimately, I’d get
              an A, but I walked away knowing almost nothing.
            </p>

            <p>
              It took me a while to realize it wasn’t just self-critical
              thinking holding me back. It was my fear of doing the work myself.
              When I skipped the struggle and jumped straight to the answer, I
              also skipped the learning. I wasn’t building the mental
              connections I needed to actually understand what was happening.
            </p>

            <p>
              That’s why repetition matters. The more you revisit a concept,
              especially across multiple days the more your brain reinforces it.
              Repetition isn’t just “doing the same thing again” it’s returning
              to an idea after time has passed, when your brain has started to
              forget it. That’s where real learning happens.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Hermann Ebbinghaus</strong> one of the first scientists to
              study memory, demonstrated through his work on the forgetting
              curve that memory decays rapidly without repetition. Repeated
              exposure, however, dramatically slows this decay.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              “With any considerable number of repetitions, a relatively small
              number of relearnings is sufficient to reproduce the entire
              series.” — Hermann Ebbinghaus, Memory: A Contribution to
              Experimental Psychology (1885)
            </blockquote>

            <h2>Embrace Your Weak Points</h2>
            <p>
              Focusing only on the areas where you already feel strong won’t
              lead to much growth. It might feel productive, but it’s often just
              comfortable. Real progress comes from identifying what you avoid,
              what you fear, or what makes you feel “not smart enough” and then
              working on it slowly, one step at a time.
            </p>

            <p>
              By applying these strategies to your weakest areas, you’ll
              experience growth not just in technical skill, but also in
              confidence and resilience.
            </p>

            <h2>Prevent Burnout</h2>
            <p>
              Above all else, protect your mental health and overall well-being.
              If programming becomes an exhausting, joyless obligation, burnout
              is almost inevitable and it will affect every part of your life.
            </p>

            <p>Remember:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Don’t compare yourself to anyone but who you were yesterday

              <li>Set healthy, realistic goals</li>
              <li>Break problems into manageable pieces</li>
